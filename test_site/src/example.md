### Hello there! This is an example page output by FTL!

Youtube embed generated by an inline shortcode: 
{% sci youtube id="fWGS-878Rkc", link_text="Urre" %}

{% sc code %}
Some text put inside a codeblock by a block shortcode.

Unlike the inline flavor, block shortcodes can capture an arbitrary block of text!
{% endsc %}

Here are some emojis expanded from their names: :smile: :skull: :eagle:

Here's an image:

Here's one located elsewhere:

Here's some highlighted Rust code:
```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

This text snippet was included whole-cloth from another file:
```
+++
path = "include.tera"
+++
```

And this one was extracted from a different file using regular expressions:
```
+++
path = "post.tera"
start_at = "<body>"
end_at = "</body>"
+++
```
