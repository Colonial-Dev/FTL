### Hello there! This is an example page output by FTL!

Youtube embed generated by an inline shortcode: 
{{ youtube(id="fWGS-878Rkc", link_text="Light") %}

{% code() %}
Some text put inside a codeblock by a block shortcode.

Unlike the inline flavor, block shortcodes can capture an arbitrary block of text!
{% end %}

It's also possible to inject templating code directly into a page, which will be independently evaluated at runtime:
{% eval() %}
The title of this page is: "{{ page.title }}".
The result of 2 + 2 is: {{ 2 + 2 }}
{% end %}

Here's some highlighted Rust code:

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
