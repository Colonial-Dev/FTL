### Hello there! This is an example page output by FTL!

Youtube embed generated by an inline shortcode: 
{{ youtube(id="dWS4uIloyAU") }}

{% code() %}
Some text put inside a codeblock by a block shortcode.

Unlike the inline flavor, block shortcodes can capture an arbitrary block of text!
{% end %}

It's also possible (using the `eval()` filter) to inject templating code directly into a page, which will be independently evaluated at runtime:

{% eval() %}
<code>
The title of this page is: "{{ page.attrs.title }}".

The result of 2 + 2 is: {{ 2 + 2 }}

Wanna query the database? Do it in the templates!
{% set query = DB.query("SELECT * FROM input_files WHERE extension = ?1", "html") %}
{% for row in query %}
- File at path {{ row.path }} has id {{ row.id }}
{% endfor %}
</code>
{% end %}

Here are some emojis expanded from their names: :smile: :skull: :eagle:

Here's some highlighted Rust code:
```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
