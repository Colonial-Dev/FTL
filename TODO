- Memmap input files? Unsure just how much this will help with performance.
- Inline template expressions.
  - Different from shortcodes, these would be lines/blocks that would be directly parsed and evaluated as a MiniJinja expression.
  - This comes at a performance cost (each expression must be compiled) but allows you to eval complex logic right in a page!
  - {! expr !} for inline, !!!/!!! for blocks?
  - Alternately, extending shortcode syntax: {! expr !} stays the same, but the latter becomes {! startexpr !} and {! endexpr !}
- Header deep linking/table of contents building.
- Cachebusting that tries multiple locations if the path isn't explicit.
- Expose regex in template engine?
