FTL is a static site generator (and server) with a twist: instead of being a largely stateless Markdown-in, HTML-out pipeline, it leans on an embedded [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to track your site's past and efficiently reason about its future, enabling incremental and atomic builds.

## Roadmap
While FTL is still very much under development, lots is already implemented!

- The [core rendering subsystem](https://github.com/SomewhereOutInSpace/FTL/tree/master/src/render) is nearly complete. This includes:
    - All "prepatory operations", from file walking through frontmatter parsing and route construction.
    - A bespoke page parser/preprocessor for features like shortcodes and codeblock syntax highlighting.
    - A templating system that revolves around mitsuhiko's *excellent* [MiniJinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) engine.
        - Custom functions enable operations like querying the content database from within templates.
        - FTL also resolves the dependency graph of a site's templates using a special parser and some SQL magic, tagging pages so they can be rebuilt if their template changes. This is done recursively, so even changes to transitive dependencies will be handled.
    - A baked-in SASS compiler and HTML post-processor, based on the `grass` and `lol_html` crates respectively.
    - Since the database tracks *every* file ever input into FTL (identified by its hash), everything past the file walking step gets change detection for free and avoids
    doing any unnecessary processing.
- A [wrapper of the `sqlite` crate](https://github.com/SomewhereOutInSpace/FTL/tree/master/src/db), providing:
    - An efficient (if slightly boilerplate-y) way to serialize and deserialize types from database tables using ergonomic closures and iterators.
    - A concurrent connection pool implementation.

What still needs to be done:

- A smattering of various features in the rendering subsystem, such as a "resource" API. (Additionally, some of the aformentioned features have old, poor implementations with replacements incubating in local branches.)
- The server subsystem, which encompasses stuff like caching and the ability to add dynamic rendering "hooks" on top of simple `path -> hypertext`. (*Technically*, there's already an implementation of this in the source tree, but it was created purely for testing purposes and is currently excluded from compilation altogether.)
- A proper command-line interface - one existed earlier in development (`clap` makes it pretty easy), but it quickly lagged behind the actual desired feature set and I eventually stripped it out.

## Acknowledgements
Credit where it's due: the inspiration for (and basic design of) FTL is shamelessly cribbed from Amos/`fasterthanlime`'s closed-source `futile`, via his blog post on its design [here](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-new-website-for-2020). The implementation is all mine, but the ideas were invaluable for getting this project to escape velocity. Check his stuff out!

(The name, on the other hand, is only related by coincidence. I had settled on the name FTL back before I even knew Rust, when all I wanted to make was a Hugo-esque SSG in C#.)
